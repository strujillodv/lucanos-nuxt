Throughout the crypto ecosystem, there are different uses for many blockchain solutions that are created and others that are on the way, some examples are video games, NFT, supply chains, Defi.

Today we are going to talk about Defi (decentralized finance) as they have been gaining strength in the market and promise to change the financial system that we know. The Defi were born as a need to create an inclusive financial system, which provides better access to the unbanked population and is a catalyst for the economy. To give a simple explanation, it can be said that it seeks to partially replicate the current financial system, but without the intervention of commercial banks. Sure, I can imagine what you're thinking ... but what would that be like?

The issue is simpler than it seems, the current financial system (commercial banks) has a basic principle which is replicated in other business models and is the joining of two ends. One tip is the people or companies with available money that seek to save and invest and earn interest on that money. The other tip is people or companies that need to borrow money for their commercial or consumer activities. The bank is a ‚Äútrusted‚Äù third party that facilitates these operations and provides security to both parties involved, but‚Ä¶ it takes the best part of the business. Let me explain ... the interest rate paid by a bank to the investor or saver is very low compared to the rate charged to those who apply for a loan. In other words, that intermediation rate is taken by the bank as a profit because it is a trusted third party and in underdeveloped countries where interest rates are high, the difference is very large. It is in this space where the Defi come to play an important role because what they seek is to create a market where banks do not exist as trusted third parties and are replaced by decentralized protocols that operate with Smarts contracts, (smart contracts) that allow that security and confidence both to the investor or saver and to the one who requests a loan. Currently there are many protocols working and with a constantly growing market, just to mention a few we can see: Aave, Compound.

The operation is simple, as I have already explained, there are two participants in this model, investors or savers and credit applicants. The investor opens an account in any of the mentioned protocols or another of their preference and deposits cryptocurrencies looking for an interest rate higher than that paid by a bank, on the other hand the person who requires a credit opens an account in the protocol of their preference deposits a collateral "guarantee" in cryptocurrencies that are accepted by the protocol Eg: Bitcoin and requests a credit leaving that bitcoin as collateral, does not require additional supporting documents, or credit history and the disbursement is immediate. The Smart contract guarantees the operation for both parties, the one who places the money and the one who borrows it. Once the terms established in the Smart contract are met (installments, term, interest, etc.), the guarantee is released and returned to the loan applicant.
It is very similar to when a person leaves their own property as collateral for a loan that ranges between 60 and 70% of the property's value. In the previous example, the Bitcoin would be the property.

The following graph explains the cycle of the operation.
