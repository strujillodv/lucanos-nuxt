Real estate has always been considered a safe investment. The problem is that, in recent decades, it has become increasingly difficult for the average retail investor to obtain. The barrier to entry has become excessively high because wages have not increased at the same rate as real estate values.

## Real estate tokenization

By now you have surely heard of blockchain and asset tokenization. What you may not have heard or had a clear understanding of is how you and many others can benefit through tokenization and, in particular, real estate tokenization.

What reaction would you and everyone you know have if you could start investing in the same real estate as the big investors? Yes, even top-notch residential and / or commercial real estate is literally within your grasp now that tokenization is a reality.

What is tokenization? Tokenization is the process by which a company or asset is divided into tokens of equal rights and value. Anyone can buy the tokens at any time, without geographic limits. With a token trading platform, anyone can participate in one of the safest investments in recent years.

Real estate tokenization is one of the best use cases, in our opinion. The tokenization of physical assets benefits both asset owners and retail and institutional investors.

The main benefits of real estate tokenization for property owners or real estate developers looking to generate additional assets to their portfolio are:

- Possibility of generating liquidity. As you know, real estate assets are not the most liquid. This means that the value of that asset is locked and not available to be traded or used as cash, generally for liquidity, traditionally you would have to go to a bank and obtain a mortgage or loan with the guarantee of your real estate property. This process is long and arduous, many times it does not provide liquidity fast enough. The owner of an asset can issue tokens that represent capital, a part of the asset or debt, a loan with a percentage of annual return determined for all token holders on a pro-rata basis. Issuance on the platform can be done in a matter of minutes, and investors can purchase the securities, giving the asset owner instant liquidity.

- Decrease in the limitations for raising capital. Traditional capital raising methods as mentioned can be arduous, and the success rate is lower depending on the developer's specific circumstances such as their credit rating, business terms, prepayment assumptions, etc.

- Ability to attract new investors. Through real estate tokenization, asset owners and real estate developers can attract a new and diverse group of investors from all walks of life, from all over the world. There is a huge wave of crypto asset investors, who have made high returns in the last 5-10 years who are now interested in investing their earnings in some traditional old-school assets, and they are definitely the most open to investing. and acquire those assets through new methods. These new investors can come from anywhere in the world, there are no more geographic borders and there are more millennial investors today than at any other time in history. High net worth family offices are also showing a lot of interest in investing in real estate tokenization platforms.

- Process automation. Real estate tokenization allows digitizing and automating many processes related to investor financing and management. From allowing shareholder meetings and voting electronically, to audited smart contracts have 'rules' built into and locked into the blockchain. Depending on the form of investment, the token holders have a direct claim on the cash flows of the real estate that have been tokenized and can also obtain the corresponding capital gain on their tokens when the property is sold.

The main benefits for the investor through real estate tokenization are:

- Digital and secure ownership of your participation in the form of tokens that can be issued, transferred, registered or stored in a blockchain system. Security tokens are transferable as they are held and exchanged throughout blockchain technology.

- Liquidity. Investing in real estate security tokens also allows for quick liquidity if necessary, by selling on a trading platform. If you invested in a real estate development project, you can sell your tokens at any time if you need your investment money back before the project is built. This is not possible if you invest in a real estate development through traditional means.
- Without geographical borders. With real estate tokenization, anyone from anywhere in the world can now invest in their dream properties anywhere in the world. From investing in condos on the beaches of Tulum, Mexico, to investing in a 5-star hotel in central London, real estate tokenization makes all assets achievable.
