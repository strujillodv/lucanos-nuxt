In technical terms, the metaverse brings together Internet 3.0, augmented reality and virtual reality. Terms well known to technology lovers..

Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Meta (Facebook, whatsapp and Instagram). He defined it as a “virtual environment”. In which we can socialize, entertain ourselves, exercise, study, work and buy things. In other words, a completely digital alternate universe.

It is a technology that bets on the connection between the real and the digital. It is a vision of a 3D world where virtual reality and augmented reality are integrated.

Thanks to virtual reality they will make us feel as if we were there and thanks to augmented reality, we will feel that it really exists. It is as if, instead of seeing a video game on the screen, you were part of the video game.

If we analyze it in detail, the most common description of the metaverse is that of a virtual reality space, an alternative economy or world in which users can interact with other users within a virtual setting. Users are usually represented by avatars, and can be accessed through different technologies, for example, computers or Smartphones, although the most common will be to enter with virtual reality glasses and smart devices to access investments in that metaverse and that the idea of ​​buying land, working, socializing or going to a concert possible.

Blockchain technology that supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could also create an interesting ecosystem for digital content creation and monetization. For example, these could grant the right to use works of art or to own creatures created in the metaverse, opening the door to a new virtual economy.

The goal of the metaverse is to build an immersive experience that will become the successor to the mobile internet. The metaverses will serve to consume content in real time through virtual experiences; and they suppose the change from a place to share experiences, to a place of shared experiences.

In short, the metaverse is a trend these days and many world-class companies are already entering with significant investments, just to mention a few are Adidas, Nike, Balenciaga, Gucci, Meta (Facebook), Google, Microsoft, among others.

Additionally, investment funds are being created for the metaverse, which represents a large injection of capital.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, is looking at how to incorporate blockchain technologies into its services.
The company is "definitely considering blockchain"

There is talk of the metaverse as a single product, but in reality many metaverses will coexist that over time will have to be interoperable, that is, they can be joined through blockchain to fulfill that purpose.
To give a practical example, we can see how there are currently several early-stage metaverses that are already working, such as: Decentraland and Sandbox, these are the most popular, but others are on the way, such as Star atlas and Axie infinity, which is also a video game. play to earn.

Play to earn: These are video games where the player invests money represented in cryptocurrencies to enter the game and obtains rewards for their performance in cryptocurrencies that can later be exchanged for real money.
As mentioned above, a metaverse is a virtual economy where at an early stage it is entered through video games with various themes such as (cars, strategy, spaceships, animal farms, adventure, etc.) but as the metaverse will see businesses of everyday life, such as clothing stores, supermarkets, restaurants, sports stores, real estate, vehicles, etc. All this environment will allow cryptocurrencies to have greater adoption since in these metaverses you must pay for goods and services with money in circulation within that metaverse and those are the crypto.

The above is just a simple explanation of the metaverse but there are already many business opportunities within this environment, for this reason we already see many companies and investors wanting to buy land to develop activities, events and much more that we have today in real life . The possibilities have no limit.

What do you think of the metaverse? Ready to enter a new economy?
